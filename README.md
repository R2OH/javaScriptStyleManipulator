Exercise One: http://10.102.10.32/getting-started-at-call-box/1-2-1

Create a page that contains content of your choosing and a toolbar of buttons that utilize javascript functions to alter the style (font size, color, etc) of different elements within the page. You should have at least 5 buttons in your toolbar, two of which should increase and decrease (respectively) the font size of all of the text in your page. You may style the page, toolbar, and buttons in whatever way is most comfortable to you, but label the buttons in such a way that their function can be easily understood. Once the page has been created, link it here for documentation purposes.

Functionality to research for this:

Using JavaScript to change the style of HTML elements
html button onclick
Javascript functions
Extra Ideas:

Pair the buttons with select fields that allow a user to dynamically set CSS attributes on the page
Use jQuery .click() to trigger your Javascript functions off of non-button elements
Add functionality to hide or display your toolbar
